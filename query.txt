You should look into running a cash mint for this purpose. I think Chaumian e-cash might be a good fit for your idea.

What states donâ€™t tax outbound business payments? Those will be from where lots of payments are made into Montana via â‚¿itcoin. The next in line for orange pilling.

Last night I met my first IRL crypto degen. He had a the dye shirt and mustache. He founded some company a year or so back. Hoping he comes to my meetup so I can orange pill him.

Recent observations.

Have been doing animal based diet since January. 
Primarily beef, fruit, cheese, honey, and maple syrup.
Also have not used shampoo/conditioner with little oil concern and good hair. No complaints from wifey.

On travel past couple of days. Got lazy. Eating "normally".
Hair feels like shit. Super heavy/oily feeling.
Obvious bloating/inflammation around mid section.
Whoop strap reading in the red two days in a row.
Pimple starting on the forehead.

Coincidence? Or did I poison myself with "normal" food again?

I'll assume the later and push forward with greater resolve moving forward.

In hotel without a squatty potty. 

Just use the trashcan! Might not be comfortable but will get your legs up for that smooth ðŸ’© experience. 

Works in church bathrooms and other public places as well. 

Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.
