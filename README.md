# stackchainsiggy_nostr

This is the version made for Nostr for the Stackchain mascot that monitors for #stackjoin buys. 

I had to incorporate Jeff Thibault's Nostr-Python library and its dependencies on the package because of version discrepancies on pip and github, and also because I had to incorporate a few changes to facilitate the bot's functionality.
